## Current Work

 - In a loop, we generate random C code (`randgen.c`) using csmith, then use a hard-
coded S-function (available in `ee_post.c`) to call the `main()` function generated by csmith.

 - We build the code using `mex` command and run a Simulink model `staticmodel.slx` which uses the S-function.

 - We build using various gcc optimization flags (e.g. O0, O1, O2) and
compare checksum generated by each of these builds. If a difference is found among the generated checksums, we get an error, which is stored in `errors` directory.

 - We are using a single integer input and output variable for our s-function 
(The s-function is located at `ee_post.c`) and these variables are
added into checksum generation process.

 - Only tested in Ubuntu/Linux so far.

### Details of current implementation

In current setup, I have two hand-coded files:

 - `ee_pre.c`: Two SL input and output variables declared on top of any code, so that both csmith generated code and s-function's code can access them. Content of this file is copied and pasted on top of csmith generated `randgen.c` file.

 - `ee_post.c`: The s-function code.

And then I generate `randgen.c` by calling `csmith`. We have the `main()` function in this `randgen.c`, which calculates checksum. This `main()` function is called by the s-function.

Finally, I concat (put content of each file, one after another) all of them like this:

randgen.c + ee_post.c = staticsfun.c
