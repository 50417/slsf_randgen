# CyEMI: EMI-based Validation of Cyber-Physical System Development Tool Chain

We are investigating automated EMI-based testing of commercial cyber-physical system development tool chains (e.g. MATLAB/Simulink)

Our experiments and prototype implementation are based on the open source *SLforge* project (see below).

Check out [homepage](https://github.com/verivital/slsf_randgen/wiki) for latest news, running the tools and to contribute.

# CyFuzz: A Differential Testing Framework for Cyber-Physical Systems Development Environments

SLforge is developed extending CyFuzz's code base, which is still availale in the `cyfuzz-experiments` branch.
